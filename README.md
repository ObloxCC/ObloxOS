# ObloxOS
So in my free time I have been working on a new ui/os that is planned to have working windows* (Added) and multitasking**, it's currently not much, but it should be updated constantly***.

-Upcoming features-

    online tools
    appstore
    better window support using window API (In next version)
    bug fixes
    working settings (In next version)
    bcrypt encryption instead of SHA-256
    and more!

NOTE: Passwords are hashed but they use a highly insecure hashing method (SHA256). There are website that you can paste in the hash and they will give you the password (or whatever) almost instantly. When I have the chance I will upgrade to bcrypt (the current hashing method that's used by many websites including twitter)

-How to install-

pastebin run irjFfYZ7
